myblender is a copy of current blender development with branches for
patches and additions that I have developed.
Submodule myblenderaddons is also needed http://github.com/sambler/myblenderaddons

Some of these are developed from ideas at http://blenderstorm.org

See the wiki pages for more info about each branch
