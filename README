myblender is a copy of current blender development with branches for
patches and additions that I have developed.
Some of these are developed from ideas at http://blenderstorm.org

See the wiki pages for more info about each branch
http://wiki.github.com/sambler/myblender/

Three submodules are required to get a runnable build that correspond
to the three external modules used in the official blender svn checkout -

myblenderaddons - http://github.com/sambler/myblenderaddons
myblendercontrib - http://github.com/sambler/myblendercontrib
myblendertranslations - http://github.com/sambler/myblendertranslations
