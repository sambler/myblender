------Blender release log / bug list--------

Version: $Id$

Use this file to register bugs or to check the status of bugs.
This file consists of a number of sections:

- a section for the next release
- current

Each section is subdivided into subsections:

- new features
- critical bugs (crashes etc.)
- general bugs (unwanted behaviour)
- hardware problems
- bugs that aren't really bugs and are postponed and should be kept in mind for new features

Each line in a subsection discribes a bug or new feature and
starts with a single character indicating the status of the bug.
Here's an overview:

- bug is new and not assigned
X an uppercase letter, bug is assigned to TEGHJNFCMSZ
(Ton, Erwin, Gino, Hans, Jan, Nijn-Zu, Frank, janCo, Maarten, Strubi, Zr)

Remarks can be added on a new line starting with two spaces.

Whenever a bug has been fixed, the engineer removes the line(s) from the
current section up to the next release section.

Example files will be located in server:/home/develop/bugs . The naming
convention for these files is: YYMMDD-NN-short-discription.blend . When
more files are needed to reproduce the bug they start with the same
YYMMDD-NN numbers or they are stored in a subdirectory. Whenever a bug
is fixed, please move the file(s) to the bugs/fixed subdirectory.

Readme's and general remarks will be stored in a text window in the 
example file. Information needed for the release log, can be stored in
this file.

--- enhancement requests

S (freid@blender.nl) UV unwrapping enhancements (spherical, cyl, generic)
