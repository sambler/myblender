Blender 2.5x Series Release ToDo list:

Please check on all points before a release:
* Version bump (source/blender/blenkernel/BKE_blender.h)
  be sure to check all these variables are correct:

    BLENDER_VERSION
    BLENDER_SUBVERSION
    BLENDER_VERSION_CHAR
    BLENDER_VERSION_CYCLE
  These values are available in the api and used for documentation generation
  so they should be correct before any release, even minor ones.

* Update of splash.png (release/datafiles) and splash.png.c
  ./source/blender/editors/datafiles

* Update of readme.html (release/text)
* New Link to correct Release Log page in the operator:
  ./release/scripts/startup/bl_ui/space_info.py and
  ./source/blender/windowmanager/intern/wm_operators.c
